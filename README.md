In this project you will design a processor that can only support below instructions.

You have to implement instruction and data memory and register modules. Use your 1-bit ALU in your previous design as a module.

You have to write your own testbench on Verilog and show that the project is working right. Learn how to initialize and read a memory in PS.

Write a report that explains your Verilog modules and the testbench results. You should test all operations that ALU allows. Also report how many logic gates you used for the ALU.
